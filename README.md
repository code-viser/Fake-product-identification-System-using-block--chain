Blockchain is an emergent technology evolving at a fast pace. There is a lot of demand for software engineers in the blockchain. If you have stumbled upon this article, you are probably learning blockchain or wanting to learn blockchain soon. If you are not, read top reasons to master blockchain.

Blockchain is conceptually completely new and the best way to learn it is by doing hands-on than just going through documents and watching videos. Below are some blockchain project ideas that will suit beginners and students

# About Project
 Here we are using Block-chain because unlike a normal database, Blockchain has a non-destructive (immutable) way to track data changes over time. This means that data is not editable rather, whenever updates are made, a new block is added to the “block-chain”. This helps track historical data (authenticity and owner data) of a product.
 
 
Each product has a qr code to store the details about the product.

When a user adds the product to blockchain a node created and a hash is generated for that particular node.

So when a user scans the particular qr code it's hash is verified with blockchain's hash,based on that it decides it is genuine or not.
 

# Limitations

The user needs to have a QR code scanner in order to check the product information.
Products that have already been manufactured prior to today cannot be tracked.
